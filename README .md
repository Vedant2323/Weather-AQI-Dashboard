## 📌 Project Overview

As an Electronics & Telecommunication engineering student, I started with a hardware-based Air Quality Monitoring System using MQ7, DHT22, and PM2.5 sensors to track CO levels, humidity, temperature, and particulate matter in real-time.

To scale this idea and eliminate manual effort, I shifted focus to building a data analytics solution using **Power BI** and **Weather API**.
